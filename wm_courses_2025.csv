As Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o observes in his book Decolonizing the Mind, it is the life of a people rather than a theatre building that constitutes the principal driving force of drama. In what ways have the subject matter and dramatic devices of the selected plays sought to illuminate African life or dramatize local experiences that are of cosmic significance? This will be an ongoing question of interest as we attempt to comprehend how the plays also situate African drama in the broader postcolonial context.

AFST 346,Nommo Force: Black Acting Theories & Performance,"Sharrell Luckett and Tia Shaffer define Black acting methods as “ritual, processes, and techniques rooted in an Afrocentric centripetal paradigm where Black theory and Black modes of expression are the nucleus that informs how one interacts with various texts, literary and embodied, and how one interprets and (re)presents imaginary circumstances” (Black Acting Methods, 2017, 2). In university training programs across the United States, the acting instrument is neutralized for use in popular references and mainstream performances (Ndounou qtd. in Perkins et. al, 2018, 124). Seldomly, if at all, does such training employ a culturally relevant pedagogy that includes the theoretical contributions or training interventions instituted by Black practitioners (Ndounou 124), nor provides opportunities for actors of the global majority to investigate the ancestral wisdom they carry and fine-tune these cultural instincts, sensibilities, and impulses. Black Approaches to Acting (Nommo Force: Black Acting Theories & Performance) adds parity to actor training at William & Mary, by training actors to identify and use practical elements of African diasporic cultural traditions as performance strategies, and to own and command their inherent Nommo Force. The course encourages Black actors to value the inherent ontology, epistemology, and methodologies they bring to bear on any text and in any performance, audition or rehearsal room.

AFST 371,The Idea of Race,"CSI The idea of race emerged as a biological concept during the European Enlightenment. The earlier cultural and religious distinctions drawn among human groups were increasingly substituted or elaborated by ‘race’. Western notions of science came to legitimate a natural hierarchy within the context of colonial, slave holding and later industrial capitalist societies whose elites benefited from the idea that the inhumanity of their privilege was natural. An ideology of white supremacy emerged simultaneously from science and society, relative to which racial identities were constructed and historically transformed. Racial ideas have infused many American institutions and their pervasiveness accounts for their paradigmatic power. The history of biological anthropology is packed with reflections of broadly believed racial ideas. These ideas’ transformations can be seen in evolving theories meant to explain the relationship between human behavior and biology. This course examines those ideas in biological anthropology and related fields. Students discover aspects of race and racism in past and present society that often go unrecognized. Thus informed, students become more able to choose an anti-racist stance. They equally develop an appreciation of ways in which culture can systematically influence scientific thought, raising a more general critique of the scientific way of knowing than is limited to the example of race. Problems and prospects for theories of the interactions between human biology and behavior are considered. Cross-listed with: ANTH 371"

AFST 418,Anthropological Reflections of the African Diaspora,"Eurocentric anthropology, and historiography, often confronted black people with omissions and distortions of African and Diasporic history that belittled them while simultaneously providing tools for reclaiming cultural knowledge of self. Intellectuals from the Diaspora were thusly motivated to write from an anthropological point of view that sought to expose the lie, fill the void, and take control of ideas that empowered societies of African descent. This course explores the debate offered by Diasporans from the 18th-21st century and how its critique of “mainstream” anthropology may help further advance the field. Cross-listed with: ANTH 461"

ANTH 200,Contemporary Problems in Anthropological Perspective,"ALV Additional CSI Anthropology aims to be the holistic, comparative study of human being. In its American configuration, anthropology combines a variety of archaeological, text-analytic, and ethnographic methods that can be used to inquire human social life in virtually any historical and geographic context that we can gather evidence about. This means that anthropology is well situated for providing multifaceted, long-range insights into a wide range of social problems. It also means that self-reflexivity-in other words, the development of awareness of one’s own self and society-is built into the discipline. This course aims to demonstrate what it means to apply anthropological perspectives to some pressing contemporary problems, both globally and in the U.S. context. Our hope is that you emerge from this course with a richer understanding of these problems, a solid overview of anthropology as an academic discipline, and the ability to apply anthropological perspectives to the problems that you encounter beyond this course in a thoughtful way."

ANTH 300,History of Anthropological Theories,"Prerequisite(s): ANTH 200 or ANTH 202 CSI This seminar addresses the historical development of anthropology and explores major theories, including structural-functionalism, structuralism, cultural ecology, and symbolic anthropology. The position of anthropology and its distinctive contributions within the social sciences will be emphasized."
ANTH 301,Methods in Archaeology,"CSI NQR Starting from premise that the division between “method” and “theory” is an artificial convention, this class explores the nexus between archaeological practice and the interpretive frames driving contemporary archaeology. We focus our attention on the points in the research process where the interpretive frames of social theory meet the often messy and convoluted results of archaeological investigation. The class includes a mix of reading, lecture, student presentations, discussion, and in-class exercises. The in-class exercises allow students to gain practical laboratory experience. Class meetings will typically be organized around thematic topics, such as chronology, geoarchaeology, paleo-diets, and archaeology of war and violence. Hands on lab projects and analysis of datasets will provide you with analytical skills and experience in archaeological field and laboratory analysis. Most of the assigned readings wil be written by professional archaeologists for other professional archaeologists. Some are written in the opaque, jargon-laden prose of academia. We will discuss strategies for reading this material which will (hopefully) allow you to hone the skills necessary for understanding challenging, technical discussions."
ANTH 302,Ethnographic Research,"Prerequisite(s): ANTH 200 or ANTH 202 An introduction to ethnographic fieldwork, including research design, proposal writing, methods used in ethnographic research, and approaches to writing ethnography."
ANTH 304,The Anthropocene,"College Curriculum: COLL 350 The ‘Anthropocene’ is a word that has gained traction in contemporary conversations about the severe problems that threaten life on earth- including environmental decay, atmospheric toxicity, fossil fuel extraction, sustainable living, and global warming- pointing to the irreversible effects of human activities to our planet’s existence. This course interrogates the category of the ‘Anthropocene’: What debates surround it? What are its conceptual and political stakes? What does it say about our notions of ‘nature’, agency, and accountability? What does anthropological analysis contribute to these conversations? As we engage with the term, we will examine its intersection with a host of related conversations: about temporality, race, gender, poverty, sovereignty and the security-state, the atomic age, late industrialism, as well as environmental disasters."
ANTH 305,Comparative Colonial Studies,"The course will examine colonialism from a comparative perspective in both the ancient and the modern world. Emphasis given to early civilizations and their expansion, to European colonialism and the creation of the Third World, and to contemporary forces of colonialism."
ANTH 306,"Sex, Gender, Sexuality","College Curriculum: COLL 350 This course traces the ways anthropologists have studied gender and sexuality in societies around the world and at home, looking at how their findings have contributed to and problematized wider societal understandings of gender and sexuality. The course begins by discussing different perspectives on sex, gender, and sexuality, highlighting the advantages of an anthropologically-oriented approach. With this disciplinary framing built into the course, it is not necessary for students to have taken the Introduction to Cultural Anthropology course as a prerequisite. In order to understand the complexities of sex, gender, and sexuality, this course draws upon black feminist and postcolonial perspectives and centers questions about difference, equity, and justice. We will consider cases from the United States and globally in order to understand how race, class, gender, sex, and sexuality are constructed, experienced, and contested both historically and today. Throughout the course, we will prioritize critical analyses of power, privilege, and inequality. Cross-listed with: GSWS 306"
ANTH 307,Social Anthropology,"Prerequisite(s): ANTH 202 . An introduction to the problem of social order and meaning through a consideration of kinship, social organization, ritual and symbolism.

Cross-listed with: ENGL 308 and LING 308"
ANTH 311,"Colonialism, Slavery, & Rebellion","College Curriculum: COLL 350 This course explores the centrality of uneven structures of global power, like colonialism & capitalism, in the making of the modern world. It aims to explore the complex (un)intended consequences of colonial encounters and the effects of conquest and slavery on indigenous and black experiences. Moreover, this course interrogates the enduring legacies these processes have left on our present. To ground these inquiries historically and geographically, this class tackles colonization, slavery, and the emergence of the Atlantic world."
ANTH 312,Comparative Colonial Archaeology,"CSI The archaeology of the era since the beginning of exploration by Europeans of the non-European world with major emphasis upon North America. The domestic, industrial and military past of the 17th- 19th centuries will be examined from an anthropological viewpoint through archaeological and documentary evidence."
ANTH 314,Conservation Ethics,"Prerequisite(s): BIOL 204 or CONS 201 or ENSP 101 ALV CSI, NQR This course addresses the ethics of protecting and conserving nature. The approach to ethics is interdisciplinary and broadly involves the politics, values, norms, and moral orders that guide conservation actions in different times and geographies. Often, conservation ethics courses have focused on the history of recognized US naturalists and ecologists and their conceptions of nature. In this course, however, we will examine conservation as a diverse field made not only by experts in the Global North but also by women, BIPOC, indigenous communities, farmers, and the Global South. Hence, we will examine the different views, positions, and values that shape conservation and earth caring practices. Cases include, among others, wildlife management, hunting, conservation parks, zoos, ecotourism, convivial conservation, and cooperation. Questions include, among others, should conservation lands be returned to the tribes? How can conservation be more diverse and promote equity? Who benefits from ecotourism? Is nature an economic service to humans? Or, what ethics are involved in sterilizing, killing, or eradicating animals? This seminar has discussion, reading, writing, and research components. There will be readings, discussions, and lectures. We will also examine films, mission statements, policies, and archival documents. Students will produce an individual blog-style essay based on their own research project. Students will also contribute with an individual concept definition for a collective conservation ethics concepts toolkit. In groups, students will produce a making & doing presentation on an assigned chapter. Participation is crucial for the successful completion of the course. Cross-listed with: CONS 401"
ANTH 315,Environmental Archaeology,"CSI This course explores our understanding of the place of people in the environment and the role environmental variables play in archaeological models of cultural change. The course consists of three sections: history of environmental studies and social theory, methodologies used to study the environment, and specific case studies of the dynamics of human-environmental relationships from an archaeological perspective."
ANTH 316,Movement: Theory and Practice,"For many of us, movement is so inherent to our human experience that we take it for granted. ”Movement/Mobility/Migration” is a seminar in which we aim to reveal and challenge the assumptions we associate with movement. We examine how anthropologists, historians, philosophers, physicists, artists, and scholars in interdisciplinary fields such as disability studies and indigenous studies have examined movement both as a practice that humans and nonhumans do(or are limited in doing) and also as a concept that we construct. As a practice, we will consider various forms of small and large-scale movement, including migration, pilgrimage, dance, trade, and navigation. As a concept, we will examine both the qualities associated with movement, such as dynamism, fluidity, flexibility, ephemerality, impermanence, rootlessness, vagrancy, etc. and also how these qualities are constructed as positive and/or negative depending on the socio-political, cultural, and historical context."
ANTH 317,Insurgent Geographies,"CSI ALV According to Michel Foucault, our era’s fundamental preoccupation is space (1998 [1967]). Space and spatial practice are key themes in the study of modernity and the academic disciplines of anthropology, sociology, and geography, for example, have been central in driving these research efforts. This course adopts a multidisciplinary perspective to construct a theoretical understanding of alternate, often insurgent, social geographies. Instead of simply focusing on insurgent geographies practiced during extreme conditions or at the “margins” of governmental reach, we will examine divergent and sustainable spatial modalities practiced in everyday life. This course considers how these spatial practices map onto, shadow, and/or challenge official colonial and capitalist conceptual and material cartographies as well as create new site ontologies. Students will think through case studies ranging in time and space and include the experiences of colonial black slaves and undocumented residents of modern nation-states."
ANTH 318,The Anthropology of Racialized Bodies & Places,"Race and racism are critical machines of modern power. This course explores the historical, economic, and political processes that shaped the formation of modern race and its endurance in the present- namely modernity, capitalism, and state governance. Race and racism are historically situated ideological constructs. They are also situations and material constructions. They are conditions that have defined the existence of modern populations, in various reincarnated forms, since the 15th-century. We will examine the perspectives and material experiences of various racialized subjects. Racial technologies have never worked alone, but are intimately tied to other forms of difference and inequalities. As such, this course explores how race is linked to gender, sexuality, and class, for example."
ANTH 322,Archaeology of North America,"This course traces Native American history from the initial arrival of humans over 14,000 years ago to the colonial era. It compares social changes in different culture areas and highlights interpretive frameworks applied to these histories."
ANTH 323,Indians of North America,CSI A survey of the major culture areas of aboriginal North America north of Mexico at the time of European contact. The post-contact relations between the Native Americans and the dominant White culture and the present-day situation and problems of Native Americans will be examined.
ANTH 324,Native People of the American Southwest,"CSI ALV This course surveys the history and culture of Native peoples of the American Southwest from prehistoric settlement to present-day. These include the Hopi, Zuni, Rio Grande Pueblos, Navajos, Apaches, Akimel O’odham, and Tohono O’odham. Special attention will be given to indigenous perspectives on history, contemporary political life in these communities and their rich traditions of arts and crafts. Issues of continuity, change and revitalization will be considered."
ANTH 325,Native People of the Great Plains,"CSI ALV This course introduces students to the culture and social history of selected tribes of the Great Plains. Special emphasis will be placed upon the historical forces and conflicts that developed on the Plains from the 1700s to the present. Special emphasis will be placed on issues of settler colonialism, sovereignty, revitalization movements, treaties and federal legislation pertaining to American Indians."
ANTH 326,Indigenous Voices in Conservation,"Prerequisite(s): BIOL 204 or CONS 201 or ENSP 101 College Curriculum: COLL 350 The field of conservation emerged along with settler-colonialism at the end of the 19th century, and it was linked to white settler strategies of land appropriation and resource control. While nature, game, and wildlife became protected for settler interests (game, logging, resource extraction), indigenous peoples living in protected areas became displaced, criminalized as poachers, and persecuted. Moreover, settlers and state officers often used nature and conservation ideas to justify the displacement, genocide, and exploitation of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color. Since then, the field of conservation has been dominated by White, men, and western voices. Today, Indigenous Peoples entangle their Land-Back movement with the idea of restoring Land to the tribes and conserving their forms of stewardship, environmental practices, and cultural relations. Simultaneously, conservation actors have noticed that Indigenous peoples protect 80% of global biodiversity despite comprising less than 5%. In this context, conservation actors are increasingly seeking ways to collaborate with indigenous communities and learn from their social and environmental worldviews. At the same time, Native Tribes are increasingly leading and funding environmental projects while linking the survival and conservation of nature and Land to their resistance and survivance. This course examines how indigenous scholars and activists conceptualize, historicize, and investigate conservation, human-nature relations, and forms of stewardship and earth-caring. While doing so, indigenous voices in conservation have connected nature with histories of race, settler colonialism, eurocentrism, marginalization and poverty, gender, and family structures.

We will examine key debates about religion in general and Islam in particular, and will read articles and books exploring Muslim practice in diverse historical and geographic contexts."
ANTH 334,Etruscan Archaeology: Italy before the Romans,"ALV Additional CSI This course examines the evidence for the peoples of pre-Roman and early Roman Italy (900-100 BCE). The course provides a survey of Etruscan material culture, including architectural remains from sanctuary, funerary, and domestic contexts, and treats the artistic media of sculpture, painting, ceramics and metalwork. Topics include: Etruscan language, funerary customs, warfare, religious and votive practices, trade and contact within the Mediterranean, and the role of women and the lower classes. Cross-listed with: CLCV 349"

ANTH 338,Native Cultures of South America,"CSI This course focuses on continuity and change among different lifeways in indigenous communities in the Andean highlands and the Amazonian lowlands. We learn how indigenous institutions and organization, colonialism, economic development, and state-building have shaped contemporary communities and the issues they face. The course uses in-depth ethnographic works that cover, among other topics, kinship, social organization, ceremony and history, so that the lives of specific communities come into focus. The engagement with outside visitors provides an occasion for students to make use of this specific knowledge and reflect on its significance for decision making and accountability in an interdependent world. IR, LAS, ENSP students welcome."
ANTH 339,Inside Irish Archaeology,"CSI Additional NQR The course approaches the full scope of the archaeology of Ireland, from c. 8,000BCE to the present, from an anthropological standpoint. Students will be introduced to the processes, sites, landscapes and material culture associated with Irish history and culture from the Mesolithic through to the contemporary world, and are encouraged to consider changing interpretations of Ireland’s past. Questions about migration, settlement, external influences, and language politics all impact upon understandings of Irish culture and Irishness in the present day, as they intersect with questions of nationalism and identity, and the commodification of heritage in the 21st century. The course therefore begins by considering the role of heritage in Ireland today, with an overview of the historiography of archaeological interpretation and the practice of archaeology in both jurisdictions (Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland) on the island. Next, each major period in Irish archaeology is considered through the use of case studies and multiple sources of evidence, as well as the changing manner in which archaeological sites have been and continue to be understood, interpreted, and presented."
ANTH 343,Deciphering Ancient Egypt,"CSI ALV This course will explore the cultural history of ancient Egypt by reaching beyond kinglists and royal chronicles to gain insight into societal dynamics of class, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity from the rich visual repertoire of Egypt’s hieroglyphic writing system and art. Students will read Egyptian literary texts in translation but also develop the ability to read short statements and captions written in Egyptian hieroglyphs. Particular attention will be given to the Old and Middle Kingdoms, when the foundations of Egyptian art and literature were first established. Cross-listed with: CLCV 209 and HIST 278 and RELG 278"
ANTH 344,"Deciphering Ancient Egypt, Part 2","Prerequisite(s): ANTH 343 or CLCV 209 or HIST 278 or RELG 278 CSI ALV This spring-semester course continues the survey of ancient Egyptian cultural history that we began during the fall semester in COLL 200 “Deciphering Ancient Egypt” (Part 1); completion of that course is therefore a prerequisite for enrollment in this one. Whereas the fall-semester course focused upon the foundational aspects of Egyptian cultural history during the Old and Middle Kingdoms, this spring-semester course will instead challenge the popular view of Egyptian culture as static by highlighting the innovations of the New Kingdom through the Late Period, when Egypt underwent rapid theological, demographic, and economic transformations that resulted in an increasingly cosmopolitan society and a crisis of collective identity. Students will continue to develop their basic understanding of Egypt’s hieroglyphic writing system in order to access the many layers of meaning conveyed in the art and literature of this era. So radical were the changes to the human condition during the first millennium BCE that a leading Egyptologist has even referred to Egypt’s New Kingdom as the “threshold to the modern world!” Cross-listed with: CLCV 210 or HIST 279 or RELG 279"

ANTH 351,"People, Cultures, and the Environment of Polynesia","CSI NQR This course provides an introduction to the environments and cultures of Oceania and the Polynesian Islands, from the earliest peopling to the post-colonial era. We will consider culture histories throughout the region, starting with the earliest Pleistocene settlement of Near Oceania, voyaging and settlement of Remote Oceania, the development of Ancestral Polynesian society, and the eventual settlement of the remote Eastern Polynesian triangle. We will focus on how all Eastern Polynesian societies descended from a common ancestral culture, but how through time, with isolation and adaptation to differing island environments, each Eastern Polynesian society developed their own unique localized identity. Utilizing comparative analyses, we will compare and contrast Eastern Polynesian cultures with respect to degree of socio-political complexity, intensification of production, settlement patterns, demographic change, ritual functions of the polity, material symbols of rank, and methods of political control. Throughout the course we will consider colonial encounters and the consequences for indigenous Polynesian populations, and subsequent adaptations of these societies through time, due to colonial contexts, globalization, and climate change. Weekly lectures and readings will touch upon human induced landscape change, adaptations to marginal island environments, the effects of climate change in the region, as well as modern conservation efforts and their articulation with indigenous land rights and traditional ecological knowledge (TEK).

ANTH 371,The Idea of Race,"CSI The idea of race emerged as a biological concept during the European Enlightenment. The earlier cultural and religious distinctions drawn among human groups were increasingly substituted or elaborated by ‘race’. Western notions of science came to legitimate a natural hierarchy within the context of colonial, slave holding and later industrial capitalist societies whose elites benefited from the idea that the inhumanity of their privilege was natural. An ideology of white supremacy emerged simultaneously from science and society, relative to which racial identities were constructed and historically transformed. Racial ideas have infused many American institutions and their pervasiveness accounts for their paradigmatic power. The history of biological anthropology is packed with reflections of broadly believed racial ideas. These ideas’ transformations can be seen in evolving theories meant to explain the relationship between human behavior and biology. This course examines those ideas in biological anthropology and related fields. Students discover aspects of race and racism in past and present society that often go unrecognized. Thus informed, students become more able to choose an anti-racist stance. They equally develop an appreciation of ways in which culture can systematically influence scientific thought, raising a more general critique of the scientific way of knowing than is limited to the example of race. Problems and prospects for theories of the interactions between human biology and behavior are considered. Cross-listed with: AFST 371"
ANTH 372,Music Cultures of the Middle East,"This course focuses on the unity and diversity of musical cultures of the Middle East region. During the semester, we investigate Arab, Turkish, and Persian, musical systems in terms of musical instruments, styles, and repertoires, modal and rhythmic structures, and the effects of cultural policy and social history on musical life. We also consider case studies from Central Asia and the Islamicate world - places considered outside of the Middle East but which have much in common with it. Our semester is organized into four thematic units. First, we consider musical function and traditional contexts with special attention to folk genres and epic traditions. Second, we think about music theory/practice in the Classical Era and its intersection with cosmology, philosophy, and the emergent monotheistic religions of region. Third looking comparatively at the development of various urban music cultures, we will consider the musical and cultural impact of forces such as the Turkish Ottoman Empire, European colonial powers, and the Western, globalized, post-colonial world. Fourth, modern and contemporary musical phenomena, for example the recording and film industries, cabaret and popular music, music and migration, global hip hop, and the musical life of Middle Eastern peoples in the Diaspora provide a contemporary perspective on the present state of Middle Eastern music. The intersection of Music and Gender, Music and Spirituality, Music and Nationalism, and Music and Power, and Music and Conflict have been central to the work of ethnomusicologists of the Middle East (including me) and these topics permeate our semester. We also question the position of the researcher/author/artist throughout the semester with an eye and ear toward the (historical) ethnography of musical life. Students should complete the course with a new understanding of the aims and methods of ethnomusicology, the anthropological study of music of the world’s peoples, as well as the inter-relationship between ethnomusicology and the humanities and social sciences. Prior coursework in ethnomusicology, anthropology, or global studies is highly recommended."

CLCV 356,Comparative Slavery: From Antiquity to the Modern World,"CSI Various forms of involuntary servitude, often lumped together under the term “slavery,” are so prevalent in history as to constitute a pernicious human institution. Yet they are rarely studied in a comparative fashion to understand how these various forms, which occur in nearly every society, time period, and geographic region, differ from one another, borrow or build on one another, and survive multi-pronged attempts at eradication. For example, in the United States slavery has become synonymous with the Atlantic Slave Trade, which itself collapses various kinds of involuntary servitudes into chattel slavery. To rectify these problems, this course approaches the institution of “slavery” through a comparative lens. Beginning with Greco-Roman slavery, we will then move forward in time and across the globe to examine involuntary servitude in the Middle East (Mamluks, Jannisaries, Arabic Slavery), in Medieval Europe (feudalism), in the early modern Americas (the Atlantic Slave trade), and finally into the modern era (textile manufacturing in South Asia and human trafficking). The study of slavery from antiquity to the modern era enables us to examine the many and different facets of how this human institution manifests itself in a multitude of societies throughout time. Note: (When appropriate for College 300, course will carry a C300 attribute, listed at the schedule level.)"
CLCV 357,The Use and Abuse of Classics: Ethnicity in Antiquity and Race in the Modern US,"College Curriculum: COLL 350 This course begins in the ancient Mediterranean world where some of the earliest inquiries about human difference took place. Prompted by colonial encounters, the Greeks began to examine human origins, genealogies, and environmental theories about why humans differed from one another in physical appearance and cultural expression. Through ethnographic and scientific inquiry, Greeks and Romans analyzed, marginalized, and categorized “others” while creating a privileged identity for themselves based on ideas of liberty, citizenship, and inclusion. Recovered during the Renaissance, these ancient intellectuals informed not only the explorers of the Age of Discovery but also the philosophers of the Enlightenment. Indeed, it was the confluence of interactions between Western Europeans and indigenous populations and the reemergence of ancient ideas of “otherness” that formed the basis of Enlightenment thought on such dichotomous subjects as liberty and racism, human rights and slavery, and secularism and religiosity. The course will conclude by examining the legacies of both the Greco-Roman tradition and the Enlightenment on the creators of the modern U.S., including Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Franklin, and Hamilton, among others, and the ramifications of these influences on contemporary U.S. society."

CONS 401,Conservation Ethics,"Prerequisite(s): BIOL 204 or CONS 201 or ENSP 101 ALV CSI, NQR This course addresses the ethics of protecting and conserving nature. The approach to ethics is interdisciplinary and broadly involves the politics, values, norms, and moral orders that guide conservation actions in different times and geographies. Often, conservation ethics courses have focused on the history of recognized US naturalists and ecologists and their conceptions of nature. In this course, however, we will examine conservation as a diverse field made not only by experts in the Global North but also by women, BIPOC, indigenous communities, farmers, and the Global South. Hence, we will examine the different views, positions, and values that shape conservation and earth caring practices. Cases include, among others, wildlife management, hunting, conservation parks, zoos, ecotourism, convivial conservation, and cooperation. Questions include, among others, should conservation lands be returned to the tribes? How can conservation be more diverse and promote equity? Who benefits from ecotourism? Is nature an economic service to humans? Or, what ethics are involved in sterilizing, killing, or eradicating animals? This seminar has discussion, reading, writing, and research components. There will be readings, discussions, and lectures. We will also examine films, mission statements, policies, and archival documents. Students will produce an individual blog-style essay based on their own research project.

CONS 410,Indigenous Voices in Conservation,"Prerequisite(s): CONS 201 or ENSP 101 or BIOL 204 College Curriculum: COLL 350 The field of conservation emerged along with settler-colonialism at the end of the 19th century, and it was linked to white settler strategies of land appropriation and resource control. While nature, game, and wildlife became protected for settler interests (game, logging, resource extraction), indigenous peoples living in protected areas became displaced, criminalized as poachers, and persecuted. Moreover, settlers and state officers often used nature and conservation ideas to justify the displacement, genocide, and exploitation of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color. Since then, the field of conservation has been dominated by White, men, and western voices. Today, Indigenous Peoples entangle their Land-Back movement with the idea of restoring Land to the tribes and conserving their forms of stewardship, environmental practices, and cultural relations. Simultaneously, conservation actors have noticed that Indigenous peoples protect 80% of global biodiversity despite comprising less than 5%. In this context, conservation actors are increasingly seeking ways to collaborate with indigenous communities and learn from their social and environmental worldviews. At the same time, Native Tribes are increasingly leading and funding environmental projects while linking the survival and conservation of nature and Land to their resistance and survivance. This course examines how indigenous scholars and activists conceptualize, historicize, and investigate conservation, human-nature relations, and forms of stewardship and earth-caring. While doing so, indigenous voices in conservation have connected nature with histories of race, settler colonialism, eurocentrism, marginalization and poverty, gender, and family structures. Cross-listed with: ANTH 326"

CONS 421,Introduction to Conservation Planning,": CONS 201 The world is in the midst of a biodiversity loss crisis. An estimated 96 elephants are lost each day, a scant 3500 tigers remain in the wild, and vast habitats from rainforest to open grassland to coral reefs are rapidly degrading. Conservation practitioners typically have limited resources (money, time, and people) to combat this loss. To be effective with those resources, conservation practitioners need to carefully choose and prioritize their strategies, monitor whether they are being effective, and adapt strategies when they are not working. In addition, to obtain support from funders, partners, or stakeholders, practitioners need to be able to clearly communicate their goals and strategies, demonstrate their effectiveness, and rely on clear, transparent decision-making."

ECON 484,Economics of Growth,"Prerequisite(s): ECON 303 , ECON 304 . Explores models of economic growth with emphasis on developing economies. Examines proximates causes (factor accumulation and technology), correlates (industrialization, demography, inequality), fundamentals (geography, history, culture, institutions), and policy implications. Blends theory with empirical evidence on the convergence and divergence of percapita incomes."
ECON 485,Globalization and Inequality,"Prerequisite(s): ECON 303 and ECON 308 College Curriculum: COLL 400 This course will explore the effects of international trade on inequality within and across countries. Virtually all models of trade emphasize the distributional consequences of globalization - across countries, industries, firms, and individuals. This, combined with the growing empirical importance of economics inequality, has led to an explosion of recent work on the relationship between trade and inequality. We will explore approaches to measuring the relationship between the two, the channels through which they are related, and potential interventions to mitigate globalization’s negative effects. This course fulfills the COLL 400 capstone experience. As such, it will require you to “synthesize and apply critical analysis, solve problems in an applied and/or academic setting, create original material or original scholarship, and communicate effectively with diverse audiences.” The assignments described below are designed with these requirements in mind. After a handful of background lectures, the course will shift to a seminar style class where students will present the material and provide feedback to others. As such, it is important to prepare for and participate in class. This includes reading and thinking about assigned materials in order to discuss them. Active participation will lead to successful seminars and help suggest avenues for future research."

ENSP 351,"Capitalism, Poverty and Environmental Justice","College Curriculum: COLL 350 Karl Marx observes that, “… in the end, Capitalism will destroy both Labor and Nature.” Affirmed by our experience, we may still wonder if it is true - that our presumptive means of economic life, the source of our wealth and values, our prosperity, and the one historic economic system that has raised standards of living globally, is in the end the engine that is eroding our freedom, impoverishing millions and destroying our planet, threatening our very existence. We are inclined to view the triad of capitalism, poverty and nature as “natural law” or “facts of nature” that we cannot transcend. We fail to recognize that together they constitute a world imbricated by and subject to human action where we hold the power of change. First comes understanding. In this course we examine the systemic interrelationships of Capitalism, Poverty and Environment that produce emergent properties (templates) predicating the negative outcomes we observe as the selective degradation of peoples. From this foundation we can address questions of policy and law that amplify first order conditions and lead to systemic environmental injustice in the areas of education, health care, housing, and exposure to catastrophic environmental events. Student case studies will explore these areas."

FMST 330A,Unfinished Business: Trauma on the Haunted Screen.,"ALV CSI We will read internationally popular late 20th and early 21st Century haunting and ghost films as reflections of political and cultural traumas that have long ‘haunted’ both society and cinema in the United States and abroad. Cinematic ghost stories such as The Conjuring, Shutter Island and The Orphanage are powerful tools for raising questions about history precisely because ghosts can be thought of as place-holders for, or symbols of, memory and unfinished trauma. As Thomas Elsaesser and others have suggested, film itself is a place-holder for memory; film captures the past for us to see years later. There is an undeniable relationship between the ghosts and wraiths we see on the screen and the insubstantial qualities of film itself. Like spirits, film is brittle, flimsy and transparent. Cinematic images, too, appear made up of light and shadows; they are flickering things, like shades or ghosts. And like ghosts, 20th Century films such as Rosemary’s Baby continue to be in dialogue with or to haunt 21st Century films such asThe Conjuring, forcing us to re-evaluate history and its representation in film texts."
FMST 330B,"The Holocaust in Representation: Trauma in History, Literature, and Film","ALV CSI In this seminar we will be reading a wide range of texts depicting both the destruction of European Jewry during the Holocaust as well as postwar identity crises faced by Jewish German survivors after the war. A number of critical questions will inform our reading of historical, literary and cinematic texts such as Anne Frank’s Diary of a Young Girl, Jurek Becker’s Jacob the Liar, Daniel Goldhagen’s Hitler’s Willing Executioners, Steve Spielberg’s Schindler’s List and Roberto Benigni’s Life is Beautiful. For instance, is one obligated to depict the Holocaust ‘realistically’ or only in historical texts? Can one avoid turning this event into a ‘story’? What role does ‘unrealistic’ depiction play? Among the people touched by the events of the Holocaust, whose stories seem more ‘authentic,’ whose more ‘dramatic,’ whose more suited to a Hollywood movie than others and why? Furthermore, what is a ‘true’ portrait of the dilemmas facing German Jews after 1945? What does it mean to live in Germany and write in German as a Holocaust survivor? And finally (in this course), we will ask how some American Jews define themselves in relation to the Shoah; what do Spiegelman’s Maus and Roth’s the Counterlife tell us about the identity crisis faced by American Jews?"
FMST 330C,Darwins Dangerous Idea and Life,"CSI ALV, NQR In this course we will explore Charles Darwin’s ongoing cultural and scientific legacy over 150 years after the completion of The Origin of the Species, (completed in 1858 and first published in 1859,) perhaps the most important book written in the history of biology. Our questions about Darwin and Darwinism are not from the perspective of biologists, though, but rather from that of cultural critics. Students will first read Origin of the Species itself, and then we will turn to texts which investigate Darwin’s life as well as the many debates about and (mis)-readings of Evolution and Natural Selection from Darwin’s time until our own. Topics include but are by no means limited to: the importance of the debates (most ongoing) about evolution, various representations of Darwin and Darwinism (including its misinterpretation by German, English and American Eugenicists) and the role they play in popular culture, and the implications of Natural Selection itself."
FMST 330D,"Film, Anime, Video Games","This course will survey the “afterlife” of Surrealism, emphasizing trends from 1966 to the present, particularly those outside the French tradition.

HIST 213,Founders and Foundings in US History & Popular Memory,"CSI Additional ALV The “founders”-revolutionaries, reformers, and framers of the government of the United States-have a driving role in how Americans and the world have come to understand the culture of U.S. nationalism. From George Washington to Frederick Douglass, from Nathan Hale to Nat Turner, and from Mercy Otis Warren to Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, human lives have been rendered by popular politics into icons. Their individual contributions have most often featured in broadly palatable nationalist histories of the United States; but are increasingly the heart of critical and revisionist narratives exploring histories of white supremacism, patriarchy, and paradoxical cultures of liberty and oppression in the early republic. These revisions have their own social history, in movement-driven attempts to reform and broaden collective memory, and thereby to make political claims on the present and future of U.S. democracy. This course investigates the processes of history-writing and memory-making by which particular individual biographies have served as shorthand for these larger social processes and moral perceptions in and beyond U.S. nationalism. Through readings that deal with both history and memory; comparisons with national icons beyond the United States; and student-driven investigations of figures not located on our syllabus, we’ll deepen our understanding of the rise of early republican U.S. popular nationalism; the dynamics of elite cultures and political arguments that shaped foundational approaches to slavery, suffrage, and racial modernity; and processes underpinning the social construction of U.S. nationalist collective memory and identity since the 18th century."

HIST 256,Religion as Power in 19th c. America,"CSI ALV This course begins by exploring the discussions about “religion” and “power” conceptual tools. We’ll then develop an analytical and interpretive framework that considers religion as power. How did people acting upon the belief in gods or spirits or supernatural forces make history? This course brings that question to an examination of US history over the “long” nineteenth century–from the post-revolutionary period in the late eighteenth-century to the post-Reconstruction era extending into the early twentieth century. We’ll start with the framing of the US Constitution and the continuing debate over church-state questions, religious freedom, and the extent to which the United States was founded as a “Christian nation.” The course then looks at religion in early 19th c. Native resistance movements, evangelical revivalism and reform, African traditions and slave Christianization, proslavery and antislavery Christianity, Mormonism and patriarchy, Spiritualism and gendered power, anti-Catholicism and the Mexican War, and religion in the Civil War. We’ll conclude in the Jim Crow era with questions that continue to resonate today about the relations of religious extremism and terrorism and the intersection of religion and white supremacy."

HIST 279,"Deciphering Ancient Egypt, Part 2","Prerequisite(s): ANTH 343 or CLCV 209 or HIST 278 or RELG 278 CSI ALV This spring-semester course continues the survey of ancient Egyptian cultural history that we began during the fall semester in COLL 200 “Deciphering Ancient Egypt” (Part 1); completion of that course is therefore a prerequisite for enrollment in this one. Whereas the fall-semester course focused upon the foundational aspects of Egyptian cultural history during the Old and Middle Kingdoms, this spring-semester course will instead challenge the popular view of Egyptian culture as static by highlighting the innovations of the New Kingdom through the Late Period, when Egypt underwent rapid theological, demographic, and economic transformations that resulted in an increasingly cosmopolitan society and a crisis of collective identity. Students will continue to develop their basic understanding of Egypt’s hieroglyphic writing system in order to access the many layers of meaning conveyed in the art and literature of this era. So radical were the changes to the human condition during the first millennium BCE that a leading Egyptologist has even referred to Egypt’s New Kingdom as the “threshold to the modern world!” Cross-listed with: ANTH 344 and CLCV 210 and RELG 279"
HIST 280,West African History since 1800,"CSI Explores the survival of West Africans in ancient environments, subsequent challenges in trans-Saharan and Atlantic slave trade, colonial overrule, political independence, and ever-increasing globalization as well as relocation to rural America in the early Atlantic era and eventually to contemporary American cities.

When and why did governments choose to use extreme force against their own citizens? To what extent was the US government aware of or implicated in the violence? How were the extremes of “dirty” wars possible? How could the word “disappear,” for example, come into everyday grammar in Latin America as a transitive verb? In what ways could and did people resist?"

We will also necessarily ground our study in Italy’s colonial history, its transition throughout the twentieth-century from a country of emigration to one of immigration, and its emerging identity as a multicultural nation. While we will read select essays on postcolonial theory and Italian migration in English, all primary course readings and discussions will be in Italian.​"
ITAL 318,Italian Film of the 60s & 70s,"This course explores the rich history of Italian cinema in the 1960s and 1970s. Against the background of Italy’s economic boom years, student, women’s and labor movements, and growing political unrest, we will study the major trends and developments in Italian film culture. While the course is dedicated to a particular national cinema, we will frame our discussions not only in an Italian socio-historical context, but also in the context of inter- and trans-national cinema at large. We will watch films for form as well as content and consider questions of production and reception. This course gives proper due to the greats of auteur cinema, while also exploring the relevance, motivations and innovations of popular and genre cinema."
ITAL 320,Fascism in Italy (In English),"ALV CSI Did Fascism end in 1945 or does it persist today? When you hear someone say, “He’s a fascist,” what do they mean? Is Fascism typically or somehow endemically Italian? In this course, we will try to answer these and other questions by looking at the cultural, social, and political phenomenon of Italian Fascism from its origin in the late 1910s to its demise in the mid 1940s. We will study the genesis of Fascism as an Italian phenomenon by looking at the literary sources (propaganda essays, novels, pamphlets, journal articles), films (The old guard 1934, The Conformist 1961) and documentaries produced at the time. Lastly, we will account for the legacy of fascism in Italy and across other cultures and societies."
ITAL 322,Ecocritical Italy: Narrating the Anthropocene,"College Curriculum: COLL 300 This course addresses the relationship between narrative and the nonhuman environment in modern and contemporary Italy. More precisely, it examines how literary, cinematic and other story-based forms allow receptive audiences greater insight into the complex realities of environmental change in Italy from the post-war period until the current day. Using an environmental humanities framework, it introduces students to a diverse range of Italian texts that explore issues such as climate change, urban expansion, extractive industry, and environmental justice, as shaped by Italy’s recent histories. As it does so, it asks: How do narrative texts allow us to make sense of these issues as they relate to collective realities, individual identities, and our relationship to the nonhuman environment? Additionally, what is unique to the Italian experience and what might we learn from it? This course is rooted in the specificities of Italian culture and geography, but it engages with transnational themes that also hit much closer to home. In this, it asks students to imagine a far-flung lived experience while also making comparisons and connections to their own daily lives."
ITAL 325,The Mafia In Context: Cinematic Representations of Italian and Italian-American Organized Crime,"ALV From a regional phenomenon of criminal rebellion in Sicily, to a semi-legal global network, Cosa nostra has captured the attention of many filmmakers. In this course, we will examine the cinematic representations of the Italian mafia both in the US and in Italy. Employing the multidisciplinary frames of cultural studies, we will try to understand the impact of the mafia on society and culture. The making and unmaking of the American dream, the corruption of political systems in Italy, the disintegration of communities, and the multiple attempts to resist by activists and the judiciary will be the themes at the center of our discussion. No previous knowledge of Italian is required. The course will be entirely in taught in English."

Next, we’ll focus on questions surrounding racial identity and its intersections with our other identities, especially class and gender. Then, we’ll turn to the question of the nature of racism. Individualistic conceptions of racism will be contrasted with institutional/structural conceptions. We’ll focus on three case studies of structural racism: mass incarceration, immigration policy, and redlining in real estate. Our final topic is where we go from here in the pursuit of racial justice, with a focus on sources of hope and despair and our individual and collective responsibility."
PHIL 225,Philosophy of Love and Friendship,"ALV CSI, NQR The aim of this course is to investigate two questions: (1) What is love and friendship among human beings?

PHIL 230,Philosophy Across Cultures,"ALV CSI What is philosophy? What is it that makes a work philosophical rather than, say, religious or literary? In this course we will adopt a cross-cultural approach to answering these questions, analyzing and comparing a diverse range of philosophical texts from around the globe. By examining the different kinds of philosophical questions diverse thinkers ask, and the variety of methods they take to answer them, we will arrive at a better understanding of what philosophy is globally. As we engage with these diverse perspectives in philosophy we will also reflect on what constitutes good cross-cultural methodology. We will address the challenges that racism and colonialism present for engaging in philosophy across cultural boundaries. We will also reflect on our own identities as global citizen and what we can do to promote equal consideration and respect for diverse philosophical perspectives. As part of our practice of cross-cultural philosophical thinking we will have the opportunity to engage with several invited guests who will share their distinctive philosophical perspectives and methods."

PUBP 376,Decision Making in Foreign Policy,"This course explores how foreign policy is made and implemented in Washington DC. We will analyze the factors that shape policy choices and their execution/enforcement across a range of issue areas and institutions at both the national and international level. Since the end of the Cold War the U.S. has occupied a relatively unique position in the international community. Through its cultural, military, and economic position the U.S. has had exceptional opportunities to influence international affairs. The world, however, is far from static. Proliferating information communication technologies have amplified the reach of nonstate actors, while global economic growth has triggered the ascendance of states seeking to counterbalance U.S. power. In a world of diverse perspectives and socio-cultural values, U.S. decision makers have also increasingly had to balance a world that is increasingly multi-polar. This course intends to provide students with an overview of the principal national security process of the U.S. that exists to manage these challenges and the diverse “tools” of statecraft available to policymakers. Students will explore the national security decision-making process, and they will analyze the utility of major foreign policy tools including diplomacy in bilateral and multilateral settings, aid, trade, sanctions, intelligence, and the use of force, among others. What sets this class apart from similar coursework is that you will hear directly from the policymakers, staff members, and opinion leaders about their own approach and experience with foreign policy decision-making and implementation. By bringing in a range of actors in the foreign policy space and exposing you to several analytical models, you will be more prepared to understand and analyze work in this area."

In short, this class is a window onto the range of ways in which Muslims in different cultural and social settings have reasoned about a good life. We will read a wide range of primary and scholarly sources to examine how Muslims justify particular moral positions, the values they hold dear and the variety of ways in which, and methods by which, they conceptualize a flourishing human life at the personal, social, cultural and political levels. We will try to understand how Muslims argue about things that matter to them as religious and moral beings.

RELG 331,What is Love? Reflections from the Islamic Tradition,"ALV This seminar will examine some of the most profound and influential writings about love from the Islamic intellectual and poetic traditions. Perhaps more than any other civilization, the literary and philosophical traditions of Islamic civilization have been “love-centric.” In this course we will closely read and discuss various philosophies and theories of love from the mundane to the mystical. Through readings and discussions of the works of Ibn Hazm, ‘Attar, al-Ghazali, Ibn al-Farid, Rumi, Amir Khusro, Ibn ‘Arabi, Hafez and more, students will become familiar with the various “schools of love” of the Islamic tradition, the role of love in Islamic philosophy, theology, and mysticism, as well as the various social practices and norms surrounding love and its expression in the various Muslim societies.

RELG 340,Spiritual But Not Religious,"ALV CSI This course examines the historical development of modern-day conceptions of “spirituality” and investigates spirituality’s complex relationships with “religion,” secularism, neoliberalism, and consumerism. In particular, we seek to understand the phenomenon of a rapidly increasing number of Americans who identify as “spiritual, but not religious.” In exploring the rise and meaning of “spirituality,” the class will give special emphasis to the historical influences of consumer capitalism, the liberal political tradition, colonialism, orientalism and, relatedly, the modern reform of Asian religions such as Buddhism and Hinduism. To see the ways in which modern-day “spirituality” is intertwined with secularism, scientism, race, class, neoliberalism, and consumerism, we will examine how “spirituality” is differently constructed and understood by evangelical Christians, atheists/non-believers, and contemporary practitioners of yoga, meditation, mindfulness, transhumanism, indigenous traditions, and nature (eco-) spiritualities."
RELG 344,Religion and Sports in the U.S.,"CSI ALV Religions and sports are both indications of cultural values. When we look at the place of religions, sports, and their intersections in our lives and history, we can learn about the priorities of our culture. Some of those priorities might make us proud; others might make us uncomfortable. This course treats religions and sports as intertwined cultural phenomena that deserve our attention because, through this, we can learn much about our cultural context, social systems, and underlying values. We will start with the question of whether sport is in itself a religion, and then we will then turn to religious traditions and social issues. We will examine religion’s role in patterns of belonging and marginalization by exploring race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and immigration status. Throughout, we will look at the historical and cultural factors that bring religion and sport together. In order to deepen your understanding of justice, equity, and the value-laden processes of social inclusion and exclusion through institutional, cultural, and normative practices that are both historical and ongoing, we will explore historical, anthropological, and ethical approaches to multiple intersections of religion and sport in the U.S. At the end of this course, you will be able to describe religions and sports as disciplinary systems and show how these systems create and sustain cultural values."

THEA 346,Nommo Force: Black Acting Theories & Performance,"Sharrell Luckett and Tia Shaffer define Black acting methods as “ritual, processes, and techniques rooted in an Afrocentric centripetal paradigm where Black theory and Black modes of expression are the nucleus that informs how one interacts with various texts, literary and embodied, and how one interprets and (re)presents imaginary circumstances” (Black Acting Methods, 2017, 2). In university training programs across the United States, the acting instrument is neutralized for use in popular references and mainstream performances (Ndounou qtd. in Perkins et. al, 2018, 124). Seldomly, if at all, does such training employ a culturally relevant pedagogy that includes the theoretical contributions or training interventions instituted by Black practitioners (Ndounou 124), nor provides opportunities for actors of the global majority to investigate the ancestral wisdom they carry and fine-tune these cultural instincts, sensibilities, and impulses. Black Approaches to Acting (Nommo Force: Black Acting Theories & Performance) adds parity to actor training at William & Mary, by training actors to identify and use practical elements of African diasporic cultural traditions as performance strategies, and to own and command their inherent Nommo Force.
